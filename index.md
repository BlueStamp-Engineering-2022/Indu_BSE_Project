# Candy Color Sorter
My candy color sorter allows the user to sort candy into the different colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, brown). The machine uses the RGB frequencies to move its part different angles so that the candy can fall into the assigned color box.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone

My first milestone was wiring the different parts to supply them power which includes the arduino, breadboard, color sensor, and the two servos. The other half of my milestone was for the color sorting machine to be able to print the corresponding color when shown a paper of that color, as well as move the top servo a corresponding number of degrees so that it can drop the candy into the correct color box. I coded the color sensor to read the different RGB frequencies to interpret and print the corresponding colors based on the ranges I gave for each candy color. I figured out the ranges by taking examples of different colors and taking an average of the RGB frequencies. For wiring, I used a breadboard to simplify the otherwise complicated electrical connections with the arduino and color sensor.

# Starter Project
My starter project was the Useless Machine. The wires connected to the battery pack carried power to the arduino in order to power the motor. The motor powered the arm to move the switch the opposite way when the user flips it. The resistors are another component on the arduino which control the amount of voltage running from the system. I enjoyed learning how to solder components to the arduino. Something I struggled with was assembly of some of the parts because the amount of precision needed.
